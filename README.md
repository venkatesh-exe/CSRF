# CSRF
Demonstration of CSRF attack and Phishing attack.
I have developed a demonstration of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack using a minimalistic website example. The project utilizes PHP, SQLite, and HTML. The steps involve selecting a login page, adding credentials, creating an account if necessary, and logging in with different usernames. Notably, one account redirects to a YouTube video page upon login.

Additionally, I created a Gmail login page that connects to the same database. The purpose of this setup is to illustrate a phishing attack scenario, where unsuspecting users might unknowingly provide their Gmail credentials.
